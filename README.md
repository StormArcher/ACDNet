# ACDNet
1 Code of ACDNet. 
ACDNet was submitted to KBS and is currently in the 2nd round of revision status. 

2 Since there may be further modifications before acceptance, we provide the code of the representative model (ACDNet-R) and prediction results of ACDNet-V, ACDNet-R, ACDNet-T.  
More code will be released after acceptance.  

ACDNet-R(version1) 
The evaluation results in the paper are consistent with this version. 
This version has a lot of comments.   

ACDNet-R(version2) 
Because the symbol definition of the version1 code is inconsistent with that in the paper, we provide another version2 with the symbol definition consistent with that in the paper to facilitate readersâ€™ understanding.  

In short, if you want to get the same evaluation results as in the paper, run version 1.   
If you want to better understand the paper through the code, please refer to version 2. 

Because the code may continue to change during the revision period, we will release the final and most complete code after the paper is accepted. 

3 use "python test.py" to run the code. 
write the test datasets in "test.py"

4 the model can be downloaded by link"xxx".

5 the saliency maps of ACDNet-V, ACDNet-R, ACDNet-T can be downloaded by link"xxx".
